#Synopsis
For this project I created a simple web page for that gives an overview of vacation places and the activities on a particular place. 

#Code
For this project I only used HTML and CSS and only created a single page that can be used to build on. 
To get a plug in from a different server I used the world clock widget since it gives the ability to users to see what the current date and time is in their desired vacation place.
